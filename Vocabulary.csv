0,abate,(v) become less in amount or intensity (v) make less active or intense,Something that abates becomes fewer or less intense.

As an intransitive verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or figuratively violent, as in ""the flood of fan mail began to abate."" Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or noise, you reduce them. Pronounce abate with the stress on the second syllable (uh-BATE).",die away let up slack slack off slack slake,
0,chicanery,(n) the use of tricks to deceive someone (usually to extract money from them),Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called chicanery.,"Besides chicanery, another funny-sounding word for trickery is shenanigans. Whereas the former is always used in the singular and involves deceptive language, the latter is usually used in the plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he has begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public trust and not be returned to office in the next election cycle.",chicane guile shenanigan trickery wile,
0,disseminate,(v) cause to become widely known,"Disseminate means to spread information, knowledge, opinions widely. Semin- derives from the Latin word for seed; the idea with disseminate is that information travels like seeds sown by a farmer.","Think about a teacher distributing a hand out at the beginning of a class. The dis-  of disseminate and distribute come from the same Latin prefix which means ""apart, in a different direction."" But unlike papers distributed in class, information, once spread around in all directions, cannot be pulled back in. Think about false rumors or political smear campaigns and you'll understand that dissemination is usually a one-way process.",broadcast circularise circularize circulate diffuse disperse distribute pass around propagate spread,
0,gainsay,(v) take exception to,"Gainsay, a verb, means ""contradict"" or ""speak out against."" When you challenge authority, you gainsay, as in teachers don't like it when unruly students gainsay them.","Gainsay comes from an Old English word that means ""contradict"" or ""say against,"" as in, no one dared gainsay the principal, who is well-known for giving detention to students who so much as frown at him. If you know someone who constantly corrects others, tells them that they're wrong, and says, ""That's not true,"" more than anyone else, you have first-hand experience with the art of the gainsay.",challenge dispute,
0,latent,(adj) potentially existing but not presently evident or realized (adj) (pathology) not presently active,"Latent is an adjective that you use to describe something that is capable of becoming active or at hand, though it is not currently so.","The adjective latent is a tricky word to define because it refers to something there but not there. That is, latent means something that is capable of becoming active or at hand but has not yet achieved that state. The word arrived in Middle English from the Latin word latÄ“re which means ""to lie hidden."" It can have somewhat negative connotations because it is often used in a medical context, as in a latent illness or infection, but it can also mean good things, such as someone discovering they have latent talents or capabilities.",possible potential inactive,
0,aberrant,(adj) markedly different from an accepted norm (n) one whose behavior departs substantially from the norm of a group,Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.,"For conduct that departs from the norm, aberrant is at hand to describe it if you want to set a formal, or even scientific tone to the discussion. You can put the accent on either the first syllable (AB-er-ent) or the second (uh-BER-ent); both pronunciations are acceptable. The Latin root aberrare means ""to go astray,"" from the prefix ab- ""off, away"" plus errare ""to wander.""  Other descendants of errare in English, like error and errant, have that double -r- and also refer to something that's either not wanted or not expected.",deviant deviate,
0,coagulate,(v) change from a liquid to a thickened or solid state (v) cause to change from a liquid to a solid or thickened state (adj) transformed from a liquid into a soft semisolid or solid mass,"When liquid starts to thicken and become solid, it coagulates. When you get a cut, the blood flowing from the wound will coagulate: it will start to clot and form a solid scab so you will stop bleeding.","Many liquids have the potential to coagulate. If the cream you just poured into your coffee is spoiled, you'll see the cream coagulate as it curdles into little floating chunks. If someone has a heart condition that may result in a heart attack, he or she might take medication that keep the blood in the arteries from coagulating, or dangerously thickening.",clot clot coagulated curdled grumose grumous,
0,dissolution,(n) separation into component parts (n) the termination or disintegration of a relationship (between persons or nations) (n) the termination of a meeting (n) dissolute indulgence in sensual pleasure (n) the process of going into solution,The dissolution of a relationship means that it's broken up or ended. The dissolution of your band means you better get started on your solo album.,"Dissolution comes from the Latin word dissolutio, meaning ""a dissolving of something."" Dissolution looks very similar to ""dissolve,"" so to help you remember the meaning, think about what happens if you put paper in water â€” it breaks apart. A dissolution of a marriage is the same thing as divorce. Although it sounds like disillusion, if you try to use them interchangeably, your logic will fall apart.",disintegration breakup adjournment dissipation licentiousness looseness profligacy dissolving,
0,garrulous,(adj) full of trivial conversation,"A garrulous person just won’t stop talking (and talking, and talking, and talking...).","Garrulous comes from the Latin word garrire for ""chattering or prattling."" If someone is garrulous, he doesn't just like to talk; he indulges in talking for talking’s sake — whether or not there’s a real conversation going on. If you discover that you have a garrulous neighbor sitting next to you on the plane, you might just want to feign sleep, unless you really want to hear everything going through his mind for the entire trip.",chatty gabby loquacious talkative talky,
0,laud,"(v) praise, glorify, or honor",To laud someone means to praise them extravagantly — usually in a very public manner. A music critic might laud a new song by calling it the best summer anthem ever created.,"The word laud is from the Latin word laudere, meaning ""to praise.” To laud someone is to glorify them, or to sing their praises, even if you’re not actually singing. Movie reviewers might laud Oscar-nominated films, and your high school principal might laud the class valedictorian at graduation.",exalt extol glorify proclaim,
0,abeyance,(n) temporary cessation or suspension,"An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on ""temporary."" It is usually used with the word ""in"" or ""into""; ""in abeyance"" suggests a state of waiting or holding.","The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason â€” appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved.",suspension,
0,coda,(n) the closing section of a musical composition,"A coda is a concluding segment of a piece of music, a dance, or a statement. It's usually short and adds a final embellishment beyond a natural ending point. Like this.","Coda comes from the Latin word cauda, meaning ""tail,"" and it's good to think of it as a tail tacked onto something that in and of itself is already a whole. If you tell a story about your crazy experience getting lost in the country and sleeping at a farmer's house, you might add, as a coda, that the farmer ended up visiting you too, a year later.",finale,
0,dissonance,(n) disagreeable sounds (n) the auditory experience of sound that lacks musical quality; sound that is a disagreeable auditory experience (n) a conflict of people's opinions or actions or characters,Disagreeable sounds can be called dissonance. You know it's dissonance if you have the strong desire to cover your ears with your hands.,"Racket, noise, dissonance â€” all can describe sounds that are not pleasant. While some musicians purposely add a little dissonance into their melodies to create an unexpected sound, others, like someone who just started drum lessons, creates dissonance by accident. Dissonance can also be a conflict between people or opinions, like the dissonance you feel when you want to do something but your parents say ""no.""",noise racket disagreement dissension,harmony accord agreement

To goad is to poke something with that pointy stick. Either way, the pointiness is really essential for making things leap into action.","Originally spelled gad, meaning “spearhead,” goad first came into use as a verb in the 1570s. But say you left your pointy goading stick at home. Have no fear! You can goad people with words, too. Literally or figuratively, a goad prods and pokes and provokes people into doing something. A sheep herder might hustle his flock along with a goad, just as your mom's constant nagging and goading might finally get you sit up straight at the dinner table.",prick needle spur prod goading prod prodding spur spurring urging,
0,lethargic,(adj) deficient in alertness or activity,"When you feel lethargic, you're sluggish or lacking energy. Being sleepy or hungry can make anyone lethargic.","Being lethargic makes it hard to get anything done: you feel weak and sleepy. Whatever the reason, a lethargic person needs to snap out of it and get some energy, maybe by eating something or by taking a nap. Being lethargic also goes well with watching TV, since that takes almost no energy at all. When you feel lethargic, you don't have any energy to spare.",unenergetic unenrgetic,energetic active lively dynamic dynamical physical alert brisk lively merry rattling snappy spanking zippy canty driving high-energy indefatigable tireless unflagging unwearying strenuous vigorous enterprising spirited
0,abscond,(v) run away; usually includes taking something or somebody along,"Abscond is to escape, often taking something along. As a kid, you may have absconded from your lemonade stand — with the coffee can of cash in hand, and your bewildered sister still filling cups for your customers.","Abscond is generally used to describe someone running from law or capture, and the word abscond has been in use since the early sixteenth century — running away and hiding being nothing new. Dogs who get off the leash and dart into the woods are not necessarily absconding; they are simply making a break for it. On the other hand, the Ponzi schemer who went to live in the South of France with his client's money? He absconded.",absquatulate bolt decamp go off make off run off,
0,cogent,(adj) powerfully persuasive,"When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations of complex government policy, it’s hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.","Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool…well that’s not a cogent argument; it’s just random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with nature.",telling weighty,
0,distend,(v) cause to expand as if by internal pressure (v) swell from or as if from internal pressure (v) become wider,"A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your stomach will swell as a result of pressure from the inside.","If you’ve ever eaten too much food it won’t surprise you to learn that the verb distend traces back to the Latin words dis-, meaning “apart,” and tendere, meaning “to stretch.” Your stomach will certainly feel stretched out if you do something — like overeat — that causes it to distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs — a pregnancy would also cause a stomach to distend — but it can also refer to anything that is stretched out as a result of internal pressure.",dilate,
0,gouge,(n) an impression in a surface (as made by a blow) (n) and edge tool with a blade like a trough for cutting channels or grooves (n) the act of gouging (v) force with the thumb (v) make a groove in (v) swindle; obtain by coercion or intimidation,"To gouge can mean to make a hole or dent in something, or to swindle or steal by overcharging. If your local gas station raises prices because a storm is coming, you may say that the station owner is gouging you — and that's illegal.","The verb gouge means to cut or carve. You can use special chisels to gouge linoleum for interesting design in printing. As a noun, a gouge is the tool you would use — instead of a flat-head chisel, a gouge has a trough — to make the gouge marks of the design. Another meaning of the verb gouge is an indentation in the surface of something. If you're not careful with the screwdriver, you'll accidentally gouge a hole in the wall.",dent ding nick force out rout extort rack squeeze wring,
0,levee,(n) an embankment that is built in order to prevent a river from overflowing (n) a pier that provides a landing place on a river (n) a formal reception of visitors or guests (as at a royal court),"A levee is an embankment, like a dam, constructed to prevent the overflow of a body of water. It can also mean a formal reception. How do these two words relate? Read on...","In French, lever means to lift and se lever means to rise, literally ""lift yourself."" When the king rose from his bed and received visitors, that was a levee. When you raise up dirt or other materials to build a dam or levee, that's also a levee. Now, official levees don't involve kings––but you might hear of “a governor’s levee at the state capital.” And levee can be used as a verb, meaning to make an embankment, or shore up.",,
0,abstemious,(adj) marked by temperance in indulgence (adj) sparing in consumption of especially food and drink,"Reserve abstemious for someone who exercises restraint, especially with regard to alcohol. A rock musician may sing about enjoying wine and women, but in his private life he may be abstemious.","You might get the idea that abstemious is a relative of abstain with a change of consonant, but in fact the two words only share the abs- prefix, meaning ""away."" The -temious bit in this adjective is from Latin temetum, ""intoxicating drink,"" so it came to refer to someone who keeps alcohol (or other temptations) at arm's length. This word has the vowels a, e, i, o and u in alphabetical order; the adverb abstemiously adds the y!",light abstentious abstinent ascetic ascetical austere spartan nonindulgent strict,gluttonous crapulous crapulent crapulous edacious esurient rapacious ravening ravenous voracious wolfish greedy hoggish piggish piggy porcine swinish overgreedy too-greedy indulgent
0,commensurate,(adj) corresponding in size or degree or extent,"The word commensurate has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a commensurate punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.","When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison â€” that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word commensurate is usually followed by with or to; one thing is commensurate with or to another.",coextensive conterminous coterminous commensurable proportionate equal,incommensurate disproportionate incommensurable unequal

Whether it's alcohol or ideas, the distilled part is the most powerful.","The original meaning of distill comes from the process of making alcohol, known as distilling, in which all the impurities of a substance are vaporized and its pure, high-alcohol condensation collected. Distill eventually came to mean any process in which the essence of something is revealed. If you take notes at a lecture and then turn them into an essay for your professor, you're distilling your notes into something more pure and exact. At least, that's what you hope you're doing.",condense distil make pure purify sublimate distil distil extract distil,
0,grandiloquent,(adj) lofty in style (adj) puffed up with vanity,"Grandiloquent is a fancy term for, well, being fancy or pretentious. In fact, you might say grandiloquent is itself a pretty grandiloquent word.","The word grandiloquent generally refers to the way a person behaves or speaks. Politicians and schoolteachers are the usual suspects of this manner of behavior, known as grandiloquence, but it can refer to anything that's overbearing or pompous in style or manner. Architecture, especially, is highly guilty of being grandiloquent â€” if you check out just about anything built in the Baroque style, you could describe it as grandiloquent.",magniloquent tall overblown pompous pontifical portentous,
0,levity,(n) a manner lacking seriousness (n) feeling an inappropriate lack of seriousness,"Joking that your dead grandmother ""never looked better"" could inject some levity, or frivolity, into her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.","Levity literally means ""lightness,"" and it's often an attempt to inject some lightness or humor into an otherwise somber situation. Telling your Aunt Edna a joke while she recuperates from a skiing accident could provide the levity needed to brighten her mood. Yet levity is often used to describe humor that's not appropriate to the occasion, like telling your Aunt the joke, ""Two corpses walk into a bar..."" after her husband has just died.",,gravity solemnity
0,admonish,(v) take to task (v) admonish or counsel in terms of someone's behavior (v) warn strongly; put on guard,"To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, admonish him.","Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere ""to advise, remind,"" admonish is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means ""scold"" or ""rebuke"" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are closer synonyms.",reprove discourage monish warn caution monish,
0,compendium,(n) a publication containing a variety of works (n) a concise but comprehensive summary of a larger work,"When you search an online encyclopedia, you are searching a compendium of information on just about everything. A compendium is a comprehensive collection of something.","You can also use the word compendium to describe a collection of written works.

If your opinion diverges from mine, we do not agree. To diverge means to move apart or be separate.","The poet, Robert Frost, wrote: ""Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -/ I took the one less traveled by / And that has made all the difference."" The word diverge in the poem carries both the meaning of separating and of being apart from the main. As a poet, it was Frost's job to use words properly. Here he does not diverge from this role.",depart deviate vary,converge converge meet adjoin contact meet touch conform converge meet converge adjoin contact meet touch

Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people. Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory — but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.",social social social clustered,ungregarious unsocial nongregarious nonsocial solitary ungregarious caespitose cespitose tufted

A log is also a written record of something, and logging is keeping such a record.","The first type of log is a tree that's been cut down with the branches stripped. Think of a log cabin: it's made up of logs. Logging is when trees are cut down for lumber. The other type of log is some type of written record or list of messages. A ship captain keeps a log of notes on the ship's status and progress. When you make such a record, you're logging. Logging can be written or orally recorded.",lumber logarithm,
0,adulterate,"(v) corrupt, debase, or make impure by adding a foreign or inferior substance; often by replacing valuable ingredients with inferior ones (adj) mixed with impurities","If you adulterate something, you mess it up. You may not want to adulterate the beauty of freshly fallen snow by shoveling it, but how else are you going to get to work?","The verb adulterate comes from the Latin word adulterare, which means “to falsify,” or “to corrupt.” Whenever something original, pure, fresh, or wholesome is marred, polluted, defaced, or otherwise made inferior, it has been adulterated. Your grandfather may, for instance, believe that bartenders adulterate the name “Martini” by applying it to combinations of vodka, chocolate or anything other than a mixture of five parts gin to one part dry vermouth, on the rocks, with a twist.",debase dilute load stretch adulterated debased,

It can also be used in the sense of taking something away from someone. For example if your boss becomes insane and power mad, his handlers may divest him of his title, meaning his position is taken away from him.",deprive strip disinvest disinvest disinvest strip undress,commit invest place put enthrone invest vest
0,guileless,(adj) free of deceit,"If you are guileless, you are not a liar; you are innocent, and you might be a touch on the gullible side.","To be guileless is to be without guile. Guile is ""deceit, duplicity and trickery."" The young and uninitiated are the ones we call guileless, and they are the ones who often get stung by the more heartless among us.

You can also call them chatty or gabby, but either way, they're loquacious.","Whenever you see the Latin loqu-, you can be sure that the word has something to do with ""talking."" So a loquacious person is a person who talks a lot, and often too much. Sitting next to a loquacious person at a dinner party can make dinner a real drag.

0,aesthetic,(adj) concerning or characterized by an appreciation of beauty or good taste (adj) aesthetically pleasing (adj) relating to or dealing with the subject of aesthetics (n) (philosophy) a philosophical theory as to what is beautiful,The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.,"Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning ""perception,"" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has ""aesthetic value,"" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it).

0,harangue,(n) a loud bombastic declamation expressed with strong emotion (v) deliver a harangue to; address forcefully,"A harangue is more than a speech, louder than a discussion, and nastier than a lecture.
